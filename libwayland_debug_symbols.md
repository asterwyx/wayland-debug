To run wayland-debug in GDB mode, you need to make a debug build of libwayland. wayland-debug needs libwayland debug symbols, and libwayland compiler optimizations are known to break wayland-debug (so installing debug symbols for the normal libwayland is no longer sufficient).

wayland-debug packaging should include a debug libwayland client and server. If you need to build it yourself, the easiest way is by running `resources/get-libwayland.sh`. It will pull the latest libwayland source, build it and leave the compiled libraries in a place wayland-debug will automatically find them. You will have so sort out required dependencies yourself.
